# How does it work?

The Arizona Resolution

In 2010, the Oakland City Council passed the Arizona Resolution in response to SB1070, an Arizona law the council believed would lead to the racial profiling of people of color and those with a limited understanding of English. The law calls for a boycott of the state of Arizona and Arizona-based businesses. This is only in instances when it is practical for the city to do so (i.e. does not conflict with another law or does not have a significant addtional cost to the city).

This prohibits prohibits the city from doing the following:
	1. Entering new or amended contracts for goods or services with companies headquartered in Arizona

	2. Sending city employees to conferences or events taking place in Arizona

The resolution required the city to review its existing contracts with companies headquartered in Arizona to determine whether it is possible to end those contracts.

The law is in effect until the state recinds SB1070. Contracts must fill out Schedule B-2 to comply with the law.
