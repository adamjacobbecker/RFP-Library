## Statement of Work (SOW) for [WEBSITE NAME] User Experience Strategy and Website Redesign

#### Scope
The [AGENCY NAME] requires the services of a vendor that can provide a number of different products and/or services related to the strategic design, content creation, analysis and promotion of the overall rebranding of [WEBSITE NAME]. Through the rebranding and creative development process, [AGENCY NAME] hopes to conduct a complete audience analysis to drive external department messaging, enhance user experience and modernize the [AGENCY NAME] web presence to create a sustainable platform to promote [AGENCY NAME]’s mission and emerge as a leader in government online communication.

#### Background on the [AGENCY NAME]/[WEBSITE NAME]
The [AGENCY NAME] is divided into eight program offices, thirteen staff/support offices, twelve operations offices, twenty-one laboratory and technology centers, the Power Marketing Administration, the Energy Information Administration and the National Nuclear Security Administration – each with their own unique audiences and messaging.

The initial focus of this SOW will be on the analysis, strategy and creative development of the sites within the current [WEBSITE NAME] branding and infrastructure to develop a sustainable platform and unique presence that complies with all the standards and regulations specific to public facing government websites and online communications. Once the initial scope is complete, [AGENCY NAME] hopes to extend the SOW to include its various sub-sites and programs, push [AGENCY NAME]’s web presence into emerging media and maintain a longterm relationship with its selected vendor.

#### Overall Goal for this SOW
Overall Goal for [WEBSITE NAME] Rebranding: To discover and engage [AGENCY NAME] audiences and facilitate information and resource sharing through a clear, comprehensive and scalable front end user interface and create a top-quality, easily identifiable online presence that communicates [AGENCY NAME]’s missions.

#### Objectives for this SOW
Identify and assess [WEBSITE NAME]’s various audiences to guide research-driven information architecture, interface design and front end development alongside a complete content strategy – taking into account [AGENCY NAME]’s unique needs as a government entity. This includes the completion of an analysis of the current [AGENCY NAME]/[WEBSITE NAME] online presence and developing a set of metrics from which to measure usability and set benchmarks for success.

Refresh and reenergize the [AGENCY NAME] brand through a complete redesign of the [WEBSITE NAME] look and feel and creative templates for all of [AGENCY NAME]’s outreach channels including but not limited to print, email, mobile and social media materials. Visual representation and creative concepts should be unique to the [AGENCY NAME] and not share a similar aesthetic to other government agencies or related organizations. Design assets will be provided in multiple file formats so elements can be easily incorporated into various media and/or platforms and distributed to stakeholders for use.

Develop a clear, comprehensive manual that contains complete brand guidelines to spearhead adoption of the rebranding and ease incorporation into all [AGENCY NAME] communications; facilitating a unified voice and visual identity across the [AGENCY NAME] enterprise.

#### Deliverables
For all deliverables the contractor will provide electronic copies (unless otherwise requested) to the [AGENCY NAME] [OFFICE NAME] or other contacts when designated. All deliverable materials must comply with the laws, regulations, polices and other directives in the U.S. federal executive branch. // @todo this is vague

NOTE: Any materials created by the contractor as a work product of this contract relating to the [WEBSITE NAME] Redesign will become the sole property of the [AGENCY NAME]. // @todo add open-source criteria? The contractor shall deliver to [AGENCY NAME]:

##### Deliverable #1
A report detailing the analysis of [WEBSITE NAME]’s audiences clearly presenting in its text user personas to provide better understanding of [AGENCY NAME] stakeholders and interest groups. This report will guide the strategic content creation, user interface design and overall themes of the other Deliverable Products outlined below.

##### Deliverable #2
A complete content strategy for distribution to [AGENCY NAME]’s various web groups. This document should be an all encompassing reference manual for current and future [AGENCY NAME] content development and should address previously problematic topics including but not limited to: [LIST OF PROBLEMATIC TOPICS].

##### Deliverable #3
Information architecture (IA) and initial site map for the redesigned [WEBSITE NAME] site. This IA and site map will be used in conjunction with the content strategy (Deliverable Product #2) so copy can be revised and/or developed in-house while the contractor is in the process of executing other deliverable products. Note the IA and site map will only include content/sites currently in the [WEBSITE NAME] infrastructure. For more information on other [AGENCY NAME] sites and sub-programs, see Deliverable Product #6.

##### Deliverable #4
Initial design elements to be incorporated into the current [WEBSITE NAME] infrastructure. In order to generate internal stakeholder interest in, and adoption of, the process, small changes to the organization and design of the current [WEBSITE NAME] site will be developed and implemented as recommended based on the findings in Deliverable Product #1.

##### Deliverable #5
Complete redesign of [WEBSITE NAME] and templates for outreach materials. This includes the complete website, features, applications, blog, social media, mobile, email and newsletters, and any items deemed best to connect with the audiences identified in Deliverable Product #1.

Alongside the redesign process, [WEBSITE NAME] will be migrated into an Open Source Content Management System (likely Drupal) and the selected vendor will be required to work with the back end development team(s) in order to incorporate the [WEBSITE NAME] User Experience Strategy. The selected vendor will also be responsible for the front end development and programming required to successfully execute any of the redesigned [WEBSITE NAME] materials such as cut up, markup, CSS, scripting, etc.

Note that this deliverable may be subject to multiple rounds of revisions. [WEBSITE NAME] requires a unique look and feel and creative materials submitted that clearly resemble other government or energy-related sites will not be accepted. Further, all materials are required to be ready for technical implementation upon delivery and [AGENCY NAME] will not approve hours billed to make corrections to templated work or incorrectly formatted items.

##### Deliverable #6
